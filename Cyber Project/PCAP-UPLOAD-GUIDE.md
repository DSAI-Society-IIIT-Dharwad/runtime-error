# PCAP Upload & Analysis Guide

## Where Uploaded Files Go

**Upload Location:** `backend/uploads/`

All PCAP files you upload through the web interface are saved to:
```
D:\Hackathon Cyber\Cyber Project\Cyber Project\backend\uploads\
```

Currently uploaded files:
- `4SICS-GeekLounge-151020.pcap`
- `4SICS-GeekLounge-151021.pcap`
- `sample.pcap`

## How Upload Works (Fixed)

### Backend Process:
1. **File Upload** ‚Üí Saves to `backend/uploads/`
2. **Mode Switch** ‚Üí Stops live capture, switches to PCAP mode
3. **Data Wipe** ‚Üí Clears all old devices/flows/alerts from database
4. **PCAP Analysis** ‚Üí Parses every packet in the file
5. **DB Population** ‚Üí Extracts and saves:
   - Network flows (src/dst IPs, ports, protocols, bytes)
   - Devices (MAC addresses, IPs, vendors)
6. **Response** ‚Üí Returns packet count and analysis summary

### Frontend Process:
1. **Upload File** ‚Üí Sends file to backend
2. **Show Success Toast** ‚Üí Displays packet count
3. **Auto Reload** ‚Üí Refreshes page after 1.5 seconds to show results

## What Was Fixed

### Problem:
- Files were uploaded but analysis results weren't visible
- Dashboard showed zeros for devices/flows
- Backend wasn't populating database with PCAP data
- Frontend didn't refresh to show new data

### Solution:
1. **Backend:** Added callback function to process PCAP packets and save to DB
2. **Backend:** Added comprehensive logging to track analysis progress
3. **Backend:** Updates global `capture_manager` to PCAP mode
4. **Frontend:** Auto-reloads page after upload to fetch new data
5. **Frontend:** Shows packet count in success message

## How to Test

1. **Upload a PCAP file:**
   - Go to Settings page
   - Switch to PCAP mode
   - Click "Upload" and select a .pcap file
   - Wait for success message

2. **Check the logs:**
   ```
   backend/logs/guardian.log
   ```
   Look for:
   - `=== PCAP UPLOAD STARTED: filename.pcap ===`
   - `[PCAP Upload] Processed X flows`
   - `[PCAP Upload] Added X devices`
   - `=== PCAP UPLOAD COMPLETE ===`

3. **View results:**
   - Dashboard should show:
     - Active Devices count
     - Network Flows count
     - Device table with discovered devices
   - PCAP Analysis panel shows file details

## Troubleshooting

### If dashboard still shows zeros:

1. **Check the log file** for errors during analysis
2. **Verify file was saved:**
   ```
   dir backend\uploads
   ```
3. **Check database has data:**
   - Look at `backend/guardian.db`
   - Should have entries in `device` and `flow` tables

### If upload fails:

- Check file format (must be .pcap or .pcapng)
- Check file size (very large files may timeout)
- Check backend logs for specific error messages

### Common Errors (FIXED):

#### ‚ùå `'EDecimal' object cannot be interpreted as an integer`
**Cause:** PCAP files with high-precision timestamps  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Now converts EDecimal timestamps to float automatically

## Summary

‚úÖ **Files ARE being uploaded** to `backend/uploads/`  
‚úÖ **Analysis IS happening** and saving to database  
‚úÖ **Dashboard WILL refresh** automatically after upload  
‚úÖ **Logs WILL show** detailed progress and results  

The issue is now **FIXED**! üéâ
