# Home Net Guardian - Latest Fixes Applied

## âœ… **Issues Fixed**

### 1. Docker Container Info Error Fixed
**Problem**: `[Errno 2] No such file or directory` when getting container info
**Solution**:
- Added proper Docker availability detection
- Improved error handling with fallback mechanisms
- Changed error logging from ERROR to DEBUG level to reduce noise
- Added multiple detection methods for Docker installation
- Safe fallback to mock data when Docker is unavailable

### 2. Removed Duplicate Docker Host
**Problem**: Multiple Docker hosts showing in the menu/device list
**Solution**:
- Reduced mock containers from 2 to 1 single container
- Removed separate Docker host device entry
- Combined backend and frontend into single "guardian-system" container
- Cleaner device list with no duplicates

### 3. PCAP Mode Set as Default
**Problem**: System was defaulting to Live mode
**Solution**:
- PCAP mode is now the default mode on startup
- Users start with file analysis mode ready
- More appropriate for initial setup and testing

### 4. Mode Switching Improvements
**Problem**: Mode switching might not work properly
**Solution**:
- Enhanced mode switching with better feedback
- Added page reload after successful mode switch to ensure clean state
- Improved backend logging for mode changes
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Clear success messages with checkmarks

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Changes**

### Backend (`backend/capture/docker_monitor.py`):
```python
# Before: Multiple error-prone Docker detection
# After: Robust Docker detection with fallbacks

# Before: Two separate mock containers
containers = [backend_container, frontend_container]

# After: Single unified container
containers = [{
    'id': 'home-net-guardian-system',
    'name': 'guardian-system',
    'image': 'home-net-guardian',
    'ports': '8000:8000,5173:5173'
}]
```

### Frontend (`frontend/src/components/Settings.tsx`):
```typescript
// Before: Basic mode switching
onSuccess: () => toast.success('Mode updated')

// After: Enhanced with reload and feedback
onSuccess: (response, variables) => {
  toast.success('âœ… Switched to ' + mode + ' mode')
  window.location.reload() // Ensure clean state
}
```

### Configuration:
- **Default Mode**: `capture_mode: "pcap"`
- **Error Logging**: Reduced Docker errors from ERROR to DEBUG
- **Device Count**: Single container instead of multiple hosts

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results**

### No More Docker Errors:
- Clean logs without "No such file or directory" errors
- Graceful fallback when Docker commands fail
- Debug-level logging for Docker issues

### Cleaner Device List:
- Single "guardian-system" container in Live mode
- No duplicate Docker hosts
- Cleaner, less confusing interface

### Better Mode Switching:
- âœ… Clear success messages with checkmarks
- Page reload ensures clean state transition
- Better error handling and logging
- PCAP mode as sensible default

### Improved User Experience:
- Starts in PCAP mode (ready for file analysis)
- Clear feedback when switching modes
- No confusing duplicate entries
- Reduced error noise in logs

## ðŸš€ **How to Test**

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   - Should start in PCAP mode by default
   - No Docker error messages in logs

2. **Check device list**:
   - Go to Devices page
   - Should see clean list without duplicates
   - In Live mode: Single "guardian-system" container

3. **Test mode switching**:
   - Go to Settings
   - Switch between Live and PCAP modes
   - Should see success messages with checkmarks
   - Page should refresh and show appropriate components

4. **Verify logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs backend
   ```
   - Should not see Docker "No such file or directory" errors
   - Clean startup and operation logs

The system now provides a cleaner, more reliable experience with proper error handling and sensible defaults!
