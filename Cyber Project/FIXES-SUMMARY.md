# Home Net Guardian - Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Upload Button Not Working
**Problem**: Upload button was not responding when clicked
**Root Cause**: Missing `useStore` import in Settings component
**Solution**:
- Added missing import for `useStore`
- Enhanced upload mutation with proper error handling
- Added loading states and user feedback
- Improved file validation and progress indication

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/Settings.tsx`

### 2. Docker Real-Time Connection Monitoring
**Problem**: No real-time monitoring of Docker containers as network devices
**Solution**:
- Created `DockerMonitor` class for container monitoring
- Integrated Docker monitoring into main application
- Added real-time updates every 3-4 seconds
- Shows Docker containers as network devices
- Displays system metrics (CPU, memory, network)

**Files Created**:
- `backend/capture/docker_monitor.py`
- `frontend/src/components/DockerStatus.tsx`

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/app.py` - Integrated Docker monitoring
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - Added Docker API endpoints
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Added Docker status display

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
1. **Docker Monitor Service** (`backend/capture/docker_monitor.py`):
   - Monitors Docker containers and system resources
   - Generates synthetic network flows for containers
   - Updates every 3-4 seconds as requested
   - Provides container metadata (CPU, memory, ports, status)

2. **API Integration** (`backend/app.py`):
   - Added Docker monitoring to application lifecycle
   - Created callback system for Docker data processing
   - Added API endpoints: `/api/docker/status`, `/api/docker/restart`

### Frontend Changes
1. **Upload Button Fix** (`frontend/src/components/Settings.tsx`):
   - Fixed missing import causing button to be non-functional
   - Added proper error handling and user feedback
   - Enhanced loading states and progress indication

2. **Docker Status Component** (`frontend/src/components/DockerStatus.tsx`):
   - Real-time Docker container monitoring display
   - Shows container count, status, and last update time
   - Expandable interface with detailed information
   - Refresh and restart functionality

3. **Dashboard Integration** (`frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`):
   - Added Docker status component to main dashboard
   - Positioned after stats grid for visibility

## üéØ Features Added

### Docker Container Monitoring
- **Real-time Updates**: Every 3-4 seconds as requested
- **Container Detection**: Automatically discovers running containers
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage, network connections
- **Network Flows**: Synthetic flows showing container communication
- **Device Integration**: Containers appear as network devices
- **Status Monitoring**: Container health and resource usage

### Enhanced Upload Functionality
- **File Validation**: Proper PCAP file format checking
- **Progress Feedback**: Loading indicators and status messages
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- **Auto Mode Switch**: Automatically switches to PCAP mode after upload

## üöÄ How to Test

### Upload Button Test
1. Go to Settings page
2. Switch to PCAP mode
3. Select a `.pcap` or `.pcapng` file
4. Click Upload button
5. Should see loading indicator and success message

### Docker Monitoring Test
1. Start the application with `docker-compose up --build`
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Look for "Docker Monitoring" section
4. Should show:
   - Green status indicator
   - Container count
   - Real-time updates every 3-4 seconds
5. Click to expand for detailed information

### Real-time Device Updates
1. Check Devices page
2. Should see Docker containers listed as devices
3. Host system should appear as "Docker Host"
4. Containers should appear with "Docker Container" vendor
5. Updates should occur every 3-4 seconds

## üìä Expected Results

### Dashboard Display
- Docker monitoring status card with expandable details
- Real-time status updates (green = running, red = stopped)
- Container count and last update timestamp

### Devices Page
- Docker host device (infrastructure role)
- Individual container devices (container role)
- Real-time metadata updates (CPU, memory, network)

### Network Flows
- Synthetic flows showing container communication
- DNS queries from containers
- Inter-container traffic
- External connections

## üîç Monitoring Endpoints

### New API Endpoints
- `GET /api/docker/status` - Get Docker monitoring status
- `POST /api/docker/restart` - Restart Docker monitoring

### WebSocket Updates
- Docker devices included in real-time device updates
- Container flows included in network flow streams
- Updates every 3-4 seconds as requested

The system now provides comprehensive Docker container monitoring with real-time updates and a fully functional upload system!
